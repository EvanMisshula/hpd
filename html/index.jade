              | New York City law requires that all owners of residential buildings with 3+ units register with HPD (Department of Housing, Preservation, and Development). These registrations are used by HPD as the parties responsible when there are violation or complaints. Although "official" parcel ownership data can be found a different city database, ACRIS, the owner listed here remains the visible contact to tenants. If a tenant decides to sue their landlord in housing court, the court considers HPD registration as a valid determination of ownership.
            p 
              | It is common practice for large property-owners and landlords to use an individual LLC or corporation for building they own, and there is no legal restrictions on this. Accordingly, if one landlord owns 40 buildings, then they would regisered each of those buildings separately, under the legal enity that owns that one building. This makes it difficult to know who are the largest property owners.
            p 
              | Each "corporate owner" registration must provide a business address, typically it's the address tenant's pay their rent too and it is the offical address Housing Court uses to serve papers.
